# ATS Resume Expert

**ATS Resume Expert** is a web application designed to help job seekers by analyzing resumes and comparing them to job descriptions for technical roles such as Data Scientist, Machine Learning Engineer, Software Developer, and DevOps Engineer. This app uses Google Generative AI (Gemini) to provide resume analysis, match percentage calculations, and extraction of contact details.

## Features

- **Resume Analysis**: Compares the resume with the job description, identifying matching skills, qualifications, and experiences.
- **Resume Match Percentage**: Calculates the percentage of how well the resume aligns with the job description and provides specific feedback based on skills and qualifications.
- **Contact Details Extraction**: Extracts essential contact information (full name, phone number, email address, LinkedIn profile) from the uploaded resume.

## How It Works

1. **Input**: 
   - Users provide a job description and upload a resume in PDF format.

     - Extracting contact details from the resume.

3. **Output**: 
   - The app displays AI-generated results, including resume analysis, match percentage, or extracted contact information, depending on the userâ€™s selection.
